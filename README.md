# Smart Workflows

This is a repository for **agentic Github workflows** that use an AI agent
to automate Github projects in powerful ways.

All workflows are **plug-and-play** and **fully customizable** using natural language instructions.

## How to Use
To use Smart Workflows in your project:

1. **[Install the AI agent](https://github.com/apps/pr-pilot-ai/installations/new)** on your repository
2. Copy one or more workflows into `.github/workflows/` in your repository

That's it!

## Plug-and-Play Workflows

Smart Workflows come in two flavors **Automations** and **Tools**. 

### Automations

Workflows that run automatically in response to [Github events](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/github-event-types?apiVersion=2022-11-28)
