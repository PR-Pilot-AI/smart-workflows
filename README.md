# Smart Workflows

This is a repository for **agentic Github workflows** that use an AI agent
to automate Github projects in powerful ways.

Smart Workflows come in two flavors:
1. **Automations** - workflows that run automatically in response to Github events
2. **Tools** - workflows for you to run manually

## How to Use
To use the workflows in your project, follow these steps:

1. **[Install the AI agent](https://github.com/apps/pr-pilot-ai/installations/new)** on your repository
2. Copy one or more workflows into `.github/workflows/` in your repository

That's it! You can use the workflows from the `Actions` tab in your repository.
