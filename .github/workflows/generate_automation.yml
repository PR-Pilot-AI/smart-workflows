            Your task is to generate a new Github workflow.
            The workflow's purpose is to automate something in the Github repository by using an AI agent 
            that can understand and execute the instructions provided in the workflow file.
            
            The workflow should be called `${{ github.event.inputs.automation-name }}`.
            
            It should run when:
            ``` 
            ${{ github.event.inputs.trigger }}
            ```
            
            When triggered, the user wants the agent to do the following:
            ```
            ${{ github.event.inputs.agent-instructions }}
            ```
            
            These instructions need to be turned into an actionable step-by-step guide for the AI agent to follow.
            Make sure the step-by-step instructions are clear and concise and ONLY contain instructions that 
            the AI agent is capable of executing:
            - Searching the code base
            - CRUD operations on files
            - Reading, editing and creating Github issues
            - Searching the internet for information
            
            The workflow file must fulfill the following criteria:
            - Name of the workflow starts with an emoji (UTF-8 character)
            - Has only one job with one step that uses `PR-Pilot-AI/smart-actions/quick-task@v1`
            - The step should have the following inputs:
              - `api-key` (similar to reference workflow)
              - `agent-instructions` (Step-by-step instructions for the AI agent)
            - `agent-instructions` have the workflow inputs injected into them
            - Workflow has inputs according to the user's instructions
            - Workflow is triggered according to user's specification
            
            
            Do the following:
            1. Read `automations/format-issue/workflow.yaml` as reference to understand the desired structure of the workflow file.
            2. Turn the free-text instructions provided by the user into actionable step-by-step instructions for the AI agent.
            3. Generate the new Github workflow file in `automations/<automation-name-slug>/workflow.yaml`
