            The user wants you to create a step-by-step plan for the following:
            
            ```
            ${{ github.event.inputs.high-level-task }}
            ```
            
            The goal of the task is:
            ${{ github.event.inputs.goal }}
            
            The plan will later be executed by you, so make sure it is within your capabilities.
            The plan should:
            - Be clear and concise and use imperative language
            
            The following should NOT be part of the plan:
            - Any action that requires user input
            - Any action that requires executing scripts or code
            - Any action that requires testing or validation
            
            Create the plan.
