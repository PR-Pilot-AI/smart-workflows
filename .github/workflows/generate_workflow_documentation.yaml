            1. Look at `tools/quick-task/README.md` to see how the README file for the workflow should be structured.
            2. Read the workflow file `tools/${{ github.event.inputs.workflow }}/workflow.yaml` to understand the workflow.
            3. Create a README file in `tools/${{ github.event.inputs.workflow }}/README.md` similar to the one you read in step 1.
            4. Make sure the tool is listed in `index.yaml` and `README.md`.
