            1. Look at `automations/chat-bot/README.md` to see how the README file for the workflow should be structured.
            2. Read the workflow file `automations/${{ github.event.inputs.workflow }}/workflow.yaml` to understand the workflow.
            3. Create a README file in `automations/${{ github.event.inputs.workflow }}/README.md` similar to the one you read in step 1.
