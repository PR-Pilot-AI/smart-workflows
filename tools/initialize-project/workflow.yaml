            This is an empty project and we want to initialize it.

            1. Use the programming language and framework (if provided) to search the internet for information on how to start a project with these specifications.
            2. Compile the information into concise, actionable instructions for starting the project, including a list of initial files that need to be created.
            3. Create a Github issue in the repository with the compiled instructions and detailed list of files to create. Label the issue `needs-refinement`.
