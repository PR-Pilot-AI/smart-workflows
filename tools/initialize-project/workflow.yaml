            1. Use the `programming-language` and `framework` (if provided) inputs to search the internet for information on how to start a project with these specifications.
            2. Compile the information into concise, actionable instructions for starting the project, including a list of initial files that need to be created.
            3. Create a Github issue in the repository titled "Project Initialization Instructions" with the compiled instructions and file list. Label the issue `needs-refinement`.
