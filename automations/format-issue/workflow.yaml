          # Instructions for formatting the issue
          formatting-instructions: |
            All issues should be properly Markdown-formatted:
            * File paths and code identifiers should be enclosed in backticks
            * Code blocks should be enclosed in triple backticks
            * Issue titles should be concise, descriptive and start with an appropriate emoji (UTF-8 character)
            
            Every issue should have at least one label. Only the following labels are allowed:
            * `bug` - for bugs
            * `enhancement` - for feature requests
            * `question` - for questions
            * `documentation` - for documentation-related tasks
            
            It is IMPORTANT that you do not alter the existing content of the issue body, only the formatting.
