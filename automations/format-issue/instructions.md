# How to Format Github Issues

All issues should be properly Markdown-formatted:
* File paths and code identifiers should be enclosed in backticks
* Code blocks should be enclosed in triple backticks
* Issue titles should be concise, descriptive and start with an appropriate emoji (UTF-8 character)

Every issue should have at least one label. Only the following labels are allowed:
* `bug` - for bugs
* `enhancement` - for feature requests
* `question` - for questions
* `documentation` - for documentation-related tasks

It is IMPORTANT that you do not alter the existing content of the issue body, only the formatting.
