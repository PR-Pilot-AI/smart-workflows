            - Code is modular and reusable
            - If possible, code is tested

            - Code is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
            - Code is SOLID (Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, Dependency Inversion Principle)
