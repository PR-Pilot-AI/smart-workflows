            1. Use the `functions.read_github_issue` to read the issue with ID `${{ github.event.issue.number }}`.
            2. Analyze the issue content to understand what needs to be documented.
            3. If the documentation is file-based and can be added to the repository, use `functions.write_file` to create or update the necessary files.
            4. If the documentation cannot be directly added to the repository, compile documentation snippets and use `functions.comment_on_github_issue` to post them as a comment on the issue.
