            1. Read `TODO.md` from the main branch.
            2. Identify the next open item on the TODO list.
            3. Fulfill the identified task to the best of your abilities. If it requires making changes to the code, ensure to commit those changes with a message that includes the task description.
            4. If all items on the TODO list are completed, delete `TODO.md` and commit the deletion with a message "Completed all TODO items".
